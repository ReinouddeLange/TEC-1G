I tried to figure out how to set the jumpers / switches for my EEPROM.
My EEPROM has the following pinout:
![28C256-Pinout](https://github.com/ReinouddeLange/TEC-1G/assets/6297024/484bbbe8-2381-4a4f-b84c-6ed7f92b9db9)

The schematics are based on an EPROM with the pinout:
![27512-150-Pinout](https://github.com/ReinouddeLange/TEC-1G/assets/6297024/e5ae1d11-2cc0-403d-9c1f-9338a53a701a)

They are almost identical but some pins differ.
